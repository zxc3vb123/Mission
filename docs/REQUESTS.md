# Cross-lane requests

You need something only another lane can build. Add an entry here instead of
editing their files. The owning lane picks it up and marks it done.

Format:

```
### <your lane> -> <their lane>: one line summary
Why: what it unblocks.
Proposed: the shape of the API or behaviour you want.
Status: open | in progress | done (commit)
```

---

### actor -> items: expose the equipped tool
Why: digging speed and what can be dug must come from the tool, not from the
character being born with a shovel.
Proposed: `items.api.equipped()` returning `{ id, def }` or null, plus an
`item:equipped` event when it changes.
Status: open

### actor -> world: dig speed per material and tool
Why: hands must be slow in soil and useless against rock; a pickaxe is what opens
rock; that table belongs with the materials.
Proposed: `world.api.digSpeedFor(matIndex, toolId)` returning pixels per second,
0 meaning "this tool cannot dig this".
Status: open

### items -> content: recipe and item data tables
Why: crafting cannot be implemented against hard-coded numbers.
Proposed: `src/content/items.js`, `recipes.js`, `buildings.js` as described in
`docs/lanes/content.md`.
Status: open

### industry -> items: structure placement API
Why: machines are placed objects; lane D should not write its own placement.
Proposed: `build.api.place(defId, x, y)`, `structuresNear(x, y, r)`,
`storageAt(x, y)`.
Status: open
